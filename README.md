1. Add a Price Increment Button - `Done`

Add a button next to each product to increase its price by 10. When clicked, it should increase the price of that specific product.

2. Remove a Product - `Done`

Add a "Remove" button next to each product that allows you to remove a product from the list by its id.

3. Add a New Product - `Done`

Implement a form with two inputs (id and price) and a button to add a new product to the products list. After adding, the new product should show up in the list.

4. Sort Products by Price - `Done`

Add a button that sorts the products by price in ascending or descending order when clicked.

5. Change Product Price to a Random Value

Add a button that will set the price of each product to a random value between 1 and 1000 when clicked.

6. Filter Products by Price

Add a filter (input field) that allows the user to enter a minimum price. The list should only show products that are priced greater than or equal to that value.

7. Highlight Expensive Products

Change the background color of products that have a price greater than 500. You can do this using inline styles or CSS classes.

8. Price History (Bonus)

Store the history of price changes for each product (use an array of previous prices). Display the last 3 price changes for each product.

9. Product Categories

Add a category key to each product and implement functionality to filter products by category.
