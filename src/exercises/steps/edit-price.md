1. **Import Necessary Modules**: The code imports essential modules like `useState` from React, product data, and FontAwesome icons for editing and deleting.

2. **Initialize State Variables**: The component initializes state variables using the `useState` hook. These variables manage the active product index, product data, input value for price editing, and the visibility of the input form.

3. **Define Handling Functions**:

   - `handleDelete`: Removes a product from the list based on its ID.
   - `handleInput`: Updates the `inputValue` state as the user types in the input field.
   - `handleEdit`: Sets the active product index and input value when the user clicks on the edit button for a product.
   - `handleSubmit`: Updates the product's price with the new value entered by the user and hides the input form.

4. **Render Component JSX**:

   - The component returns JSX to render the product list and an input form for editing prices if `showInput` is true.

5. **Map Over Product Array**: It iterates over the `product` array and renders each product item with its details like name, description, category, price, and availability.

6. **Display Input Form for Editing**: If `showInput` is true, it renders an input form for editing the price of the active product.

7. **Implement Edit and Delete Functionality**: Each product item has buttons for editing and deleting. When clicked, these buttons trigger their respective handling functions (`handleEdit` and `handleDelete`).

8. **Handle Input Form Submission**: When the user submits the edited price, the `handleSubmit` function is called. It updates the product's price with the new value entered by the user and hides the input form.

9. **Add CSS Styles**: The code includes CSS classes for styling, such as setting borders, colors, spacing, and layout.

10. **Interactivity and User Feedback**: The code provides interactivity by allowing users to edit and delete products. It also includes user feedback, such as alerts for empty input fields and visual cues for active products.

These steps outline how the provided code creates a React component for editing product prices, including managing state, handling user input, rendering components, and implementing interactivity.
